# primordial ooze
simplest species. may aggregate into collectives.

- [ ] comb filter
- [ ] delay
- [ ] envelope
- [ ] FM operator
- [ ] noise source
- [ ] filter
- [ ] impulse
- [ ] crossfader
- [ ] tanh
- [ ] array/table (perhaps implemented as env)
- [ ] note/degree -> cycle/period (TET, JI)
- [ ] beat -> cycle/period (BPM, quavers, seconds)

# aspirations
- history always recorded (timestamps)
- history is malleable and randomly accessible
- repo provides only primordial species
- complexity strictly emergent
- global fossil record as single source of truth
- collective lifeforms self-optimize blueprints
- lifeforms reproduce (polyphony)
- lifeforms mutate/evolve
- species interact

# DNA, blood, guts, bones
- lua API to create, route, aggregate, control
- primordial forms in subdir a la dronecaster
- serializable biome history
- global audio/control buffer (i.e. WAV), loose propriety via index range
