# overview
## species
organismic blueprint

## specimen
instance of organism

## biome
organism habitat

# primordial ooze
simplest species. may aggregate into collectives.

# aspirations
- history always recorded (timestamps)
- history is malleable and randomly accessible
- repo provides only primordial species
- complexity mostly emergent
- global fossil record as single source of truth
- collective lifeforms self-optimize blueprints
- lifeforms reproduce (polyphony)
- lifeforms mutate/evolve
- species interact

# DNA, blood, guts, bones
- lua API to create, route, aggregate, control
- primordial forms in subdir a la dronecaster
- serializable biome history
- global audio/control buffer (i.e. WAV), loose propriety via index range

# hypotheses
## travel light
be resourceful and carry less.
pack reliable multitaskers.

## multichannel expansion
modulation is interesting in clusters of related signals.
these have slightly different parameters. 
the constellation between these parameters is itself parametric.
a chord is an example.
so is a chorus.

## field lab
record and recall history and observations explicitly.
summon lifeforms; manage connections.
